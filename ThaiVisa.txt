According to the Immigration Act of Thailand B.E. 2522 (1979), several categories of foreigners are prohibited from entering Thailand. Foreigners without a genuine valid passport or a document used in lieu of a passport, or those with a valid passport or document but without a proper visa issued by the Royal Thai Embassies, the Royal Thai Consulates-General, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs—unless exempted by visa exemption requirements—fall into this category. Additionally, foreigners lacking appropriate means of living after entry into the Kingdom are also prohibited. Those entering the Kingdom for employment as unskilled or untrained laborers or in violation of the Alien Work Permit Law are barred from entry. Individuals who are mentally unstable or have diseases listed in the Ministerial Regulations are also excluded. Foreigners who have not been vaccinated against smallpox or received other required vaccinations and refuse to undergo such treatments by the Immigration Doctor face entry restrictions.

Individuals who have been imprisoned by a Thai Court or by a foreign court, except for minor offenses or cases specifically exempted by Ministerial Regulations, are prohibited. Those whose behavior poses a potential danger to the public, who may be a nuisance, or who might engage in violence or pose a threat to public safety or national security are also barred from entry. This prohibition extends to those under arrest warrants by foreign governments. If there is reason to believe that a foreigner's purpose of entry is involvement in prostitution, trafficking of women or children, drug smuggling, or other immoral activities, entry will be denied.

Furthermore, foreigners without the prescribed amount of money or bond, as specified under Section 14 of the Immigration Act B.E. 2522 (1979), are not allowed entry. Foreigners prohibited by the Minister under Section 16 of the same Act are also excluded.
